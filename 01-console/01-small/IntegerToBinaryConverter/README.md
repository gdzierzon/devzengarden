# Integer to Binary Converter

Prompt the user for a whole number (Base 10). Convert the number into a Binary (Base 2) string and display the result of the conversion.

0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => 10
3 => 11
4 => 100
5 => 101
6 => 110
7 => 111
8 => 1000

### Example
```
Enter a whole number to convert: 35
35 in binary is 100011

Enter a whole number to convert: 58
58 in binary is 111010
```

Although many languages have built in functions that can do this for you - the purpose of this exercise is to design your own algorithm to perform this conversion.
