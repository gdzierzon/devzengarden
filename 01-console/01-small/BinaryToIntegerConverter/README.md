# Binary to Integer Converter

Prompt the user for a Binary (Base 2) number. Convert the number into an Integer (Base 10) and display the result of the conversion.


0 => 0
1 => 1
10 => 2
11 => 3
100 => 4
101 => 5
110 => 6
111 => 7
1000 => 8

### Example
```
Enter a binary number to convert: 100011
100011 convertet to an integer is 35

Enter a whole number to convert: 111010
111010 converted to an integer is 58
```

Although many languages have built in functions to do this for you - the purpose of this exercise is to design your own algorithm to perform this conversion.
