# Binary to Integer Converter

Prompt the user for a Binary number. Convert the number into an Integer and display the result of the conversion.

### Example
```
Enter a binary number to convert: 100011
100011 convertet to an integer is 35

Enter a whole number to convert: 111010
111010 converted to an integer is 58
```

Although many languages have built in functions to do this for you - the purpose of this exercise is to design your own algorithm to perform this conversion.
