# Hexadecimal to Integer Converter

Prompt the user for a hexadecimal string (Base 16 number). Convert the number into an Integer (Base 10) and display the result of the conversion.

0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => 2
...
8 => 8
9 => 9
A => 10
B => 11
C => 12
D => 13
E => 14
F => 15
10 => 16
11 => 17

### Example
```
Enter a whole number to convert: AD
AD from hex to int is 173

Enter a whole number to convert: 3A
3A from hex to int is 58
```

Although many languages have built in functions that can do this for you - the purpose of this exercise is to design your own algorithm to perform this conversion.
