# Integer to Hexadecimal Converter

Prompt the user for a whole number (Base 10). Convert the number into a Hexadecimal (Base 16) string and display the result of the conversion.

0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => 2
...
8 => 8
9 => 9
10 => A
11 => B
12 => C
13 => D
14 => E
15 => F
16 => 10
17 => 11

### Example
```
Enter a whole number to convert: 173
173 in hex is AD

Enter a whole number to convert: 58
58 in hex is 3A
```

Although many languages have built in functions that can do this for you - the purpose of this exercise is to design your own algorithm to perform this conversion.
